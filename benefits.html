    <p>
        <br>
        <b>Affordable and Lightweight:</b> Plastic is a more affordable and lighter alternative to many natural materials.<br><br>
        <b>Versatile and Moldable:</b> The name "PLASTIC" comes from the Greek word "plastikos" meaning "capable of being molded or shaped."<br>
        This unique property allows it to be formed into various shapes, making it useful for countless applications.<br><br>
        <b>Strong and Durable:</b> During World War II, plastic was a durable, heat-resistant, and electrical-insulating substitute for scarce metals, proving to be a cheap, lightweight, and strong material.<br><br>
        <b>Durable:</b> It was used in essential items like telephones, radios, and electrical appliances.

        <b>Environmental Pollution:</b> Plastic waste has become a global crisis. It harms marine life, pollutes soil and rivers, and clogs drinking water sources.<br><br>
        <b>Harm to Human Health:</b> Plastics release harmful chemicals, such as BPA and phthalates, which can enter our food and water.<br>
        Diseases linked with plastic exposure include cancer, respiratory issues, hormonal imbalance, and digestive problems.<br><br>
        <b>Non-Biodegradable:</b> Unlike natural materials, plastic does not break down easily and can remain in the environment for centuries.
